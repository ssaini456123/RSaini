# R. Saini
The robotic Saini. <br>

I would prefer if instead of running my bot on your local machine, you just invite it. I set it up so that anyone can use it. No one has to waste money. <br>

Features checklist (in no particular order):
```
[] Basic command parsing
[] Command API that is usable for anyone to add features onto
[] PostgresQL stuff


other stuff that are not mentioned here are probably also WIP.
```
