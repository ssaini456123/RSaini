# R. Saini
The robotic Saini. <br>

I would prefer if instead of running my bot on your local machine, you just invite it. I set it up so that anyone can use it. No one has to waste money. <br>

Features checklist (in no particular order):
```
[x] Basic command parsing
[x] Command API that is usable for anyone to add features onto
[x] PostgresQL stuff
[x] user timezones
[x] starboards
[] tags 


other stuff that are not mentioned here are probably also WIP.
```
